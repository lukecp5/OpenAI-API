# ChatGPT API Request App
This is a full-stack [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application that uses the [OpenAI GPT-3 API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to generate a chat completion response based on user input. The front-end is built with [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), and the back-end is powered by an Express server.

The application contains a simple form that prompts the user to input a language and a brief description of an application. When the user submits the form, the application sends an API request to the ChatGPT servers using the user's input as the content of the request. The response from the API is then displayed on a new ReactJS page.

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project directory. You'll also need to set up an environment variable for your OpenAI API key in a .env file.

This project is a great starting point for developers who want to learn how to use the OpenAI API and build full-stack applications with Node.js and ReactJS. Feel free to fork this repository and customize it to suit your own needs!
